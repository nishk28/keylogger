# Python Keylogger Tutorial for Beginners

This repository contains the source code for a simple **keylogger** built using Python and the `pynput` library. The keylogger captures every keystroke and logs it into a text file. It is an educational project, ideal for beginners who want to learn more about how keyloggers work and explore **ethical hacking**.

---

## Features

- Capture keystrokes including letters, numbers, and special keys (space, enter, etc.)
- Save the captured data into a local text file (`key_log.txt`)
- Compatible with both Linux and Windows
- Easy-to-understand code for beginners
- Ethical hacking project for learning purposes

---

## Prerequisites

Before running the keylogger, make sure you have:

- **Python 3.x** installed
- The **pynput** library installed

You can install `pynput` using pip:

```bash
pip install pynput
```

---

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-keylogger.git
   cd python-keylogger
   ```

2. **Install the required library**:
   Install the `pynput` library with:
   ```bash
   pip install pynput
   ```

3. **Run the keylogger**:
   To start logging keystrokes, run:
   ```bash
   python3 keylogger.py
   ```

4. **Check the log file**:
   The keystrokes will be saved to a file named `key_log.txt` in the same directory.

## Code Explanation

Here is a brief breakdown of the keylogger code:

- **`on_press()`**: This function captures regular and special keys (like space, enter) when pressed and logs them in a file.
- **`on_release()`**: This function checks if the escape key is pressed, and if so, stops the keylogger.
- **`Listener`**: This listens for key press and release events.
